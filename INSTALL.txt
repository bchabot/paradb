=System Requirements=

The AGHOST Paranormal Reporting Database requires Apache 1.3.x or higher,
PHP 4.3.x or higher, and MySQL 4.x or higher.  This software has been tested
primarily on Linux, and it should work without modification on any other
UNIX-like operating system that supports Apache, MySQL and PHP.  It may also
work on Windows Server, but it has not been tested on this platform at all.
If you do get it running on Windows with Apache/MySQL/PHP, please feel free
to drop me an email (obsid@sentry.net) and let me know how it works.


=Installation=

 This software can typically be installed and working in less than 10 minutes,
 depending on your familiarity with setting up web services and database.  The
 most difficult part of this installation is probably setting up the database.
 The phpMyAdmin application can make this task a lot easier for you.  You may
 already have the this utility available.  Check with your web hosting provider
 if you're not sure.


 Follow the following steps to install this software:

  1) ParaDB is distributed in a number of archive formats; .zip, .tar.gz and
     .tar.bz2.  Extract the files from this archive using the appropriate
     application.  On Windows XP, for example, you simply need to double-click
     on the ParaDB zip archive, called paradb-0.2.0.zip or similar and drag the
     directory called "paradb" to your desktop or wherever you wish to place it.


  2) Upload the paradb directory and its contents to some place that is
     accessible to your web server (eg. into the "htdocs" directory).


  3) Create a database called "paradb".  Your web host may be able to help you
     with this.


  4) Create a database user called "paradb".  Your web host may be able to help
     you with this.

	- Assign this user at least the 'select', 'insert', 'update'
	  and 'delete' privileges to the paradb database.


  5) Run the SQL script contained in the file paradb/install/paradb.sql. 
     This should create 35 tables in the 'paradb'database.  If you get any 
     errors here, stop and troubleshoot before moving on.  Again, the phpMyAdmin
     application can help you with this.  Just select the 'paradb' database
     you created, click the "SQL" tab, paste the contents of paradb.sql in the
     form and click "Go".


  6) Edit the file paradb/include/reportsdb.inc.php:

	- Make sure the $DB_NAME is set to 'paradb' or whatever you 
	  called the database you created in step 2.

	- Make sure the $DB_USER is set to 'paradb' or whatever you 
	  called the user you created in step 3.

	- Set the $DB_PASS variable to the password you chose for the 
	  database user you created in step 3.


  7) Look through this file and configure other variables as needed.
     Other variables that should be edited include $LOGFILE, $ADMIN_EMAIL,
     $MAIL_FROM, $baseurl and $server_path.

	- The $baseurl variable should be set to the external URL that
	  can be used to access the software (eg. http://myserver.com/paradb).

	- The $server_path variable should be set to the full path
	  to the paradb directory on the server.  You should be able
	  to obtain this information from your hosting provider.  For
	  example, your path might be '/var/webusers/steve', so the
	  $server_path will be '/var/webusers/steve/paradb'.


  8) If everything has gone OK so far, you should now be able to navigate 
     to http://<domain>/paradb and log in.  The default username/password 
     is admin/admin.


  9) After logging in, you can create new users and change the administrator 
     password by clicking on the "User Management" link in the left navigation 
     bar.


  =Installation Notes=

    After installation you may the log in as the administrator using the username
    "admin" with password "admin" (without the quotes in both cases).

    To take advantage of the graph generation in the Statistics page, you will need
    the Image_Graph PEAR package installed on your server.  The package can be obtained
    at the following location: http://pear.php.net/package/Image_Graph.  If you're working
    in a shared hosting environment, then you may already have it installed.

    The "paradb/images/stats_images" directory must be writable by the web server if you
    wish to use the statistics generation functionality.  This is where the generated
    plots get stored.



=Upgrading=

 The upgrading procedure should be pretty simple.  Since you already have the
 database configured, all you should really need to do is upload all the files
 to your web host, being particularly careful not to overwrite your main
 configuration file "paradb/include/reportsdb.inc.php".

  1) BACKUP THE PARADB DATABASE.

  2) BACKUP YOUR PARADB INSTALLATION ON YOUR WEB HOST.

  3) The above steps are easy to ignore, but really, backing up your database
     and current installation of ParaDB is just a good idea.  In fact, it's
     a good idea when upgrading any piece of software.  It only takes a moment,
     and can save you a lot of trouble if something goes wrong.

  4) ParaDB is distributed in a number of archive formats; .zip, .tar.gz and
     .tar.bz2.  Extract the files from this archive using the appropriate
     application.  On Windows XP, for example, you simply need to double-click
     on the ParaDB zip archive, called paradb-0.2.0.zip or similar and drag the
     directory called "paradb" to your desktop or wherever you wish to place it.

  5) Back up your current ParaDB configuration file, called
     "paradb/include/reportsdb.inc.php" on your web host.  If you accidentally
     overwrite this you will need to re-create it and re-add the correct values
     for your database username/password, etc.

  6) Upload the paradb directory and its contents to some place that is
     accessible to your web server (eg. into the "htdocs" directory).  Don't
     overwrite your configuration file, called "paradb/include/reportsdb.inc.php".

  7) It's usually easiest to just edit the new reportsdb.inc.php file that came
     with this distribution so that it matches your configuration, and then
     upload it to the paradb/include/ directory.  This way you can be sure
     you have the most current version of this file.
